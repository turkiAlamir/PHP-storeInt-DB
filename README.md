# PHP-storeInt-DB
this is a simple html-php page which is tested using xampp and to make sure it runs succesfully there must be a database with the name "sensordata" and a table with the name "vals" and a row with the name sensor this is however if the included sql file doesn't work 
the page is simple all you have to do is write the integer in the box and then press "submit"
